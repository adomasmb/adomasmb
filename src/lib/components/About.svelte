    Adomas (Adam) Morkūnas-Budrys is one of the most promising Lithuanian conductors of his generation. Known for his wide range of musical taste, Adam is especially passionate about large-scale symphonic works, nordic and contemporary music. He is also always keen to explore the compositions of less-known artists and introduce them to orchestras and the public.
    Adam has worked with such orchestras as the Finnish Radio Symphony, Manchester Camerata, Helsinki Philharmonic, Lithuanian National Symphony, Thessaloniki State Symphony, Lithuanian Chamber, Olten Philharmonic of Izmir, Südwestdeutsche Philharmonie Konstanz, MÁV Symphony, Joensuu City, St. Christopher Chamber, and others. He has worked in such opera houses as Bayerische Staatsoper and Opera de Lyon and collaborated with and assisted such conductors as Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla, Titus Engel, and Modestas Pitrėnas. In masterclasses, he has worked with Paavo Järvi, Bernard Haitink, Jorma Panula, Nicolas Pasquet, Larry Rachleff, Nicholas Collon, Pavel Baleff, Eva Ollikainen, James Lowe, and others.
    Alongside conducting, Adam is also a composer, arranger, pianist, and organizer of various musical events. Since 2018, Adam has been the main organizer of the Future Symphony Competition, which has happened three times already. Being a chief conductor of the Future Symphony Orchestra, he has already premiered 19 orchestral compositions.
    Adam currently studies for his Master’s in orchestra conducting at Sibelius Academy (prof. Sakari Oramo). Before that, he completed his Bachelor’s degree with Prof. Johannes Schlaefli at Zürich University of the Arts and with Prof. Ole Kristian Ruud at the Norwegian Academy of Music as an exchange student.
